> 🧭 **Context:** These credits came from a mix of Sophia + time at Clemson University.

> At Clemson I originally studied **Biomedical Engineering**, later switched to **Pre-Vet** — so many transfer courses reflect a very different academic direction than software engineering.

### 🔎 Term Retrospective

**Focus:** Core IT literacy and technical environment awareness.

This term established non-programming foundations required for software work: operating systems, networking, and data fundamentals. While not development-heavy, these courses built the mental model for how software interacts with real infrastructure.

#### Key Skills Developed 
- Understanding system-level constraints (OS, hardware, networking)
- Reading technical documentation instead of relying on tutorials
- Foundational SQL and relational database theory
- Translating technical communication to non-technical audiences.

#### What I Would Do Differently
At the time, I treated these courses as "supporting courses." In hindsight, I would spend more time mapping these concepts directly to application development (e.g., how networking affects APIs, or how OS scheduling impacts performance).

I also would have maybe chosen some other courses to take first to start with more momentum. These courses (especially Data Management - Foundations, Hardware and Operating Systems Essentials, and Networking Security) were very information heavy. While all of this was important knowledge to have, it felt a little overwhelming at times trying to navigate actually retaining all the knowledge instead of memorizing for the test.

#### How This Term Shows Up in My Work Now
This foundation influences how I design backend systems — especially thinking about:
- Environment configuration
- Deployment context
- Data persistence strategy

### 🔎 Term Retrospective

**Focus:** Transition from theory into writing code and building interfaces.

This term marked the shift from IT knowledge into actual software construction. I began working with scripting, frontend development, and version control in a practical way.

#### Key Skills Developed
- Writing maintainable JavaScript instead of one-off scripts
- Using Git as a development tool (not just submission requirement)
- Structuring UI with usability and accessibility in mind
- Thinking about systems as interacting components

#### What I would Do Differently
- I would introduce project-based repetition earlier. Much of my early code worked but lacked structure. Rebuilding small projects multiple times would have accelerated pattern recognition.

#### How This Term Shows Up in My Work Now
This was when I stopped thinking like a student and started thinking like a builder:
- Organizing repos intentionally 
- Separating logic from presentation
- Writing code meant to be revised later

### 🔎 Term Retrospective

**Focus:** Data-driven applications, cloud concepts, and multi-language exposure. 

This term expanded into backend thinking, database design, and cloud awareness. I began working across multiple languages (JavaScript, Python) and understanding how applications scale beyond local execution.

> I received **two** certificates in this term:

| Code | Course | Certificate Awarded |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| D282 | Cloud Foundations | AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner |
| D336 | Business of IT - Applications | ITIL Foundation Certification | 

</div>

#### Key Skills Developed
- Schema design and query optimization
- Evaluating cloud tradeoffs instead of treating cloud as "magic"
- Writing backend logic that interacts with persistent data
- UX considerations tied to real workflows

#### What I Would Do Differently
I would begin documenting architecture decisions earlier. Understanding *why* something worked became just as important as making it work. 

#### How This Term Shows Up in My Work Now
This term shaped how I approach full-stack development: 
- Thinking in data flow rather than isolated features
- Designing around state, not just UI
- Considering deployment environments during development
