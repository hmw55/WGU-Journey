📌 Course Purpose
</h2>

This course validated the ability to communicate technical ideas to a non-technical business audience using professional writing, research integration, and structured presentation delivery.

Rather than focusing on programming, the emphasis was on an often underdeveloped engineering skill:

> Translating technical solutions into language stakeholders can understand and act on.

🧠 Competencies Developed
</h2>

- Writing structured technical explanations for business audiences
- Supporting recommendations using external research
- Adjusting tone and terminology based on audience knowledge level
- Creating visual presentations to reinforce written proposals
- Delivering narrated material clearly and concisely

These skills map directly to real-work activities like:
- Writing design proposals
- Explaining architecture tradeoffs
- Documenting system changes
- Presenting solutions to leadership

📂 Project Overview (High-Level)
</h2>

This course required producing two related artifacts:

### Task 1 — Written Technical Proposal
A research-backed explainer recommending adoption of a specific technology solution within a business scenario.

My submission evaluated implementing an ERP platform to address scaling challenges in a growing retail environment, including customer tracking and inventory management improvements.

The document required:
- Explaining the technology conceptually
- Arguing for business value
- Supporting claims with sources
- Tailoring tone to decision-makers rather than engineers

### Task 2 — Multimedia Presentation
The second deliverable translated the written proposal into a concise executive-style presentation.

The slides summarized the operational value of ERP, CRM, and inventory visibility concepts, emphasizing clarity over technical depth.

A recorded narration accompanied the slides to simulate presenting to leadership.

🔁 Iteration & Revision Experience
</h2>

This course introduced an important real-world dynamic:

**Technical work is reviewed — and must be revised.**

My first submission of Task 1 required correction in how sources were cited and aligned with references. The evaluator noted missing or unclear reference mapping, prompting a revision cycle focused on accuracy and traceability.

That experience reinforced:
- Precision matters as much as content
- Documentation must be verifiable 
- Professional communication includes citation discipline

The second attempt corrected these issues and met competency expectations.

🧩 Skills That Carried Forward
</h2>

Although this was not a coding course, it influenced later development work more than expected.

It changed how I approach:
- Writing README files and project documentation
- Structuring explanations before implementation
- Considering the audience before diving into technical detail
- Supporting design decisions with rationale rather than intuition

🔍 What I Would Do Differently
</h2>

If repeating this course, I would:
- Start citation management earlier instead of retrofitting references
- Draft outlines focused on audience needs before writing
- Pair the communication work with small technical prototype to connect theory with implementation

🚀 Relevance to Software Engineering
</h2>

Software engineers do not just write code — they justify, document, and communicate decisions.

This course established the professional communication is part of engineering, not separate from it.

📎 Work Completed (Summary Only)
</h2>

This course included:
- A written technical explainer recommending adoption of a business technology solution
- Research integration using multiple external sources
- Audience-focused writing tailored to non-technical stakeholders
- A slide-based presentation translating the written proposal into executive-level communication
- A narrated walkthrough simulating delivery to decision-makers
